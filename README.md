# jit-quake
jit.Quake is a demonstration of a Max/MSP Jitter patch that captures the desktop and applies randomly-generated, four channel color noise. 
The jit.net.send object sends the captured content to another computer so the desktop capture isn't interrupted by making the video full screen. 
The level played is Ziggurat Vertigo.
